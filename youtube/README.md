YouTube Video Views Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses Linear Regression (Machine Learning) to predict the number of views a YouTube video will get in the first 24 hours based on content-related factors.

Problem Statement
To predict Views in 24 Hours using:

Thumbnail quality

Posting time

Dataset (youtube.csv)
The dataset should contain the following columns:

Column Name Description ThumbnailQuality Quality score of thumbnail numeric PostingTime Time of posting numeric/category encoded Views24Hours Views in first 24 hours

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Linear Regression

How the Model Works
Load dataset from youtube.csv

Select input features (ThumbnailQuality, PostingTime)

Train a Linear Regression model

Predict views for new video data

Example Prediction
view = reg.predict([[7,4]]) print("views on video in 24 hours:", view)

Input Format: [ThumbnailQuality, PostingTime] [7, 4]

Output: views on video in 24 hours: [[4965.99423631]]

(Exact value depends on the dataset)

How to Run the Project
Install Required Libraries pip install pandas scikit-learn

Run the Python File python views_prediction.py
