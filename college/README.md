College Admission Prediction using Decision Tree

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn to predict whether a student will get admission based on:

Percentage in 12th grade

Entrance Exam result

Category

The output is:

Admission: Yes / No

Dataset Requirements (collage.csv)
The CSV file must contain the following columns: Column Name Description Values

Percentage12th 12th Percentage category Low / Medium / High EntranceExam Entrance test result Pass / Fail Category Student category General / Reserved Admission Final decision Yes / No

Encoding Used
Categorical values are converted into numbers:

Percentage12th
Low → 0

Medium → 2

High → 1

EntranceExam
Pass → 1

Fail → 0

Category
General → 1

Reserved → 0

Admission
Yes → 1

No → 0

Requirements
Install required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

How to Run
Place collage.csv in the same folder as the Python script

Run the program:

python collage.py

The output will be:
predicted result is: [1]

1 means Admission = Yes 0 means Admission = No

Prediction Example
The following input is used in the code:

dtree.predict([[2, 1, 1]])

Which means:

Percentage12th = Medium

EntranceExam = Pass

Category = General

Model Used
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier

Library: scikit-learn
