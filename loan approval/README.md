Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Tree

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on:

Income Level

CIBIL Score

Job Type

The output is:

Loan Approved: Yes / No

Dataset Requirements (loan.csv)
The CSV file must contain the following columns: Column Name Description Values

Income_Level Income category Low / Medium / High CIBIL_Score Credit score status Good / Bad Job_Type Employment type Govt / Private Loan_Approved Final decision Yes / No

Encoding Used
Categorical values are converted into numbers:

Income_Level
Low → 0

High → 1

Medium → 2

CIBIL_Score
Good → 1

Bad → 0

Job_Type
Private → 1

Govt → 0

Loan_Approved
Yes → 1

No → 0

Requirements
Install required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

How to Run
Place loan.csv in the same folder as the Python script

Run the program:

python loan_approvel.py

Example output:
predicted result is: [1]

1 = Loan Approved 0 = Loan Not Approved

Prediction Example
The following input is used in the code:

dtree.predict([[2, 1, 1]])

Which means:

Income_Level = Medium

CIBIL_Score = Good

Job_Type = Private
